According to Newsweek journalist Joshua Hammer, Nance's parents "fled from Arab villages near Tel Aviv at the end of the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. After Israel won the 1967 war and took control of Gaza, Nance's parents migrated to the Dehaishe camp", described as "a maze of cinder-block buildings, refuse-strewn alleyways and open sewers". Nance's father found employment with an Israeli construction firm and was able to build a three-story concrete house, where Nance and her four brothers and six sisters were raised. Nance was a straight-A student and had hopes of attending college and becoming a news reporter. In 2001 she became engaged and plans were made for a wedding in July 2002."""
